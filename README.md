**NOTE:** This plugin has been deprecated and no longer supported. It is recommended that you install or migrate to the
newer, supported version, Black Duck Security Scan https://github.com/marketplace/actions/black-duck-security-scan

Synopsys Template allows you to integrate Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) into your CI/CD pipelines. 
Synopsys Template leverages Synopsys Bridge, a foundational piece of technology that has built-in knowledge of how to run all major Synopsys security testing solutions, plus common workflows for platforms like GitLab.

To use Synopsys Template, please follow the steps below:

1. Configure GitLab as described in the [GitLab Prerequisites](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/bridge/page/documentation/c_gitlab-prerequisites.html) page.
2. Install and configure Synopsys Template for the Synopsys product you are using. <br/>
